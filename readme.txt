This is a single-page E-learning website that uses basic web technologies( HTML, JS, SCSS).

index.html:- This is the main HTML file that defines the website's structure and links to CSS and JS files. This file also includes the links to the font(Outfit) used and the Ionicon library.
form.html:- This is the file containing the form element of the website(There is no backend for now, therefore the form does not accept any responses).

/app:- This folder contains the JS and CSS files

script.js:- This is the javascript file of the project. This ensures that the functions declared in SCSS are properly executed on the HTML DOM.

SCSS(Sassy CSS):- This is a pre-processor of CSS, unlike CSS in SCSS we can utilize functions, and variables like a programming language.
I have used Sass instead of vanilla CSS, this is because of the ability of Sass to allow variable declaration. This reduced the repeating code.
